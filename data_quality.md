Ensuring high data quality is essential for reliable analysis, reporting, and decision-making. Here are some crucial data quality techniques:

### 1. Data Profiling

#### Description:
Data profiling involves analyzing existing data to understand its structure, content, and quality.

#### Techniques:
- **Column Analysis**: Assess the distribution of values in each column (e.g., min, max, mean, null counts).
  ```sql
  SELECT
    MIN(column_name) AS min_value,
    MAX(column_name) AS max_value,
    AVG(column_name) AS avg_value,
    COUNT(*) AS total_count,
    COUNT(column_name) AS non_null_count,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(column_name) AS null_count
  FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Pattern Analysis**: Identify patterns in the data (e.g., email format validation).
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name NOT LIKE '%_@__%.__%';
  ```

- **Frequency Distribution**: Analyze the frequency of distinct values.
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) AS frequency
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column_name
  ORDER BY frequency DESC;
  ```

### 2. Data Cleansing

#### Description:
Data cleansing involves correcting or removing inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant data.

#### Techniques:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Fill or remove missing data.
  ```sql
  -- Fill missing values with a default value
  UPDATE table_name
  SET column_name = 'default_value'
  WHERE column_name IS NULL;
  ```

- **Standardization**: Ensure data follows a standard format.
  ```sql
  -- Convert text to lowercase
  UPDATE table_name
  SET column_name = LOWER(column_name);
  ```

- **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate records.
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM table_name
  WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id)
    FROM table_name
    GROUP BY unique_column
  );
  ```

### 3. Data Validation

#### Description:
Data validation ensures that data meets the required standards and business rules before it is processed.

#### Techniques:
- **Constraint Validation**: Use database constraints to enforce data quality.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  ADD CONSTRAINT unique_constraint UNIQUE (column_name);
  ```

- **Custom Validation Rules**: Apply custom validation logic.
  ```sql
  -- Check for invalid values
  SELECT *
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name NOT IN ('valid_value1', 'valid_value2');
  ```

- **Automated Validation**: Use scripts or tools to automate validation checks.
  ```python
  # Example in Python
  def validate_data(row):
      if not re.match(r'^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}$', row['email']):
          return False
      return True

  df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
  valid_data = df[df.apply(validate_data, axis=1)]
  ```

### 4. Data Enrichment

#### Description:
Data enrichment involves enhancing existing data by adding additional information from external sources.

#### Techniques:
- **Third-Party Data**: Integrate data from third-party sources to add context or missing information.
  ```sql
  -- Example: Add geolocation data
  UPDATE table_name t
  SET t.city = e.city, t.country = e.country
  FROM external_data e
  WHERE t.zipcode = e.zipcode;
  ```

- **Data Integration**: Combine data from different sources to create a comprehensive dataset.
  ```sql
  -- Join data from two tables
  SELECT t1.*, t2.additional_info
  FROM table1 t1
  JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.key = t2.key;
  ```

### 5. Master Data Management (MDM)

#### Description:
MDM involves creating a single, consistent view of key business entities across the organization.

#### Techniques:
- **Centralized MDM**: Use a central repository to manage master data.
  ```sql
  -- Example of a central repository for customer data
  CREATE TABLE CustomerMaster (
    CustomerID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(255),
    ContactInfo JSONB,
    UNIQUE(CustomerName)
  );
  ```

- **Data Governance**: Establish policies and procedures for maintaining data quality.
  - Define data ownership and stewardship roles.
  - Implement data quality metrics and monitoring.

### 6. Data Auditing

#### Description:
Data auditing involves systematically reviewing and verifying the accuracy and integrity of data.

#### Techniques:
- **Audit Trails**: Track changes to data over time.
  ```sql
  -- Example of an audit table
  CREATE TABLE AuditLog (
    AuditID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    TableName VARCHAR(255),
    ColumnName VARCHAR(255),
    OldValue TEXT,
    NewValue TEXT,
    ChangedBy VARCHAR(255),
    ChangedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );

  -- Trigger to log changes
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_changes() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO AuditLog (TableName, ColumnName, OldValue, NewValue, ChangedBy)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, OLD.column_name, NEW.column_name, CURRENT_USER);
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  CREATE TRIGGER audit_trigger
  AFTER UPDATE ON table_name
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION log_changes();
  ```

- **Periodic Reviews**: Regularly review data quality metrics and perform audits.
  ```sql
  -- Example of a periodic review query
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    COUNT(column_name) AS non_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN column_name IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_count
  FROM table_name;
  ```

### 7. Data Lineage

#### Description:
Data lineage involves tracking the flow of data from its origin to its destination, ensuring transparency and traceability.

#### Techniques:
- **Lineage Tracking Tools**: Use tools to automatically track data lineage.
  - Tools: Apache Atlas, Talend, Informatica

- **Manual Documentation**: Document data flow and transformations.
  ```yaml
  # Example of a manual documentation in YAML
  data_flow:
    source: "raw_data.csv"
    transformations:
      - name: "clean_data"
        type: "cleaning"
        description: "Remove null values and standardize formats"
      - name: "aggregate_data"
        type: "aggregation"
        description: "Summarize data by category"
    destination: "cleaned_data.csv"
  ```

### 8. Data Quality Dashboards

#### Description:
Data quality dashboards provide a visual representation of data quality metrics, helping to monitor and improve data quality.

#### Techniques:
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Define and track KPIs related to data quality.
  - Examples: Completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness
- **Visualization Tools**: Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or custom dashboards to visualize data quality metrics.

### 9. Anomaly Detection

#### Description:
Anomaly detection involves identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm.

#### Techniques:
- **Statistical Methods**: Use statistical techniques to detect anomalies.
  ```python
  # Z-score method in Python
  df['z_score'] = (df['column_name'] - df['column_name'].mean()) / df['column_name'].std()
  anomalies = df[df['z_score'].abs() > 3]
  ```

- **Machine Learning**: Apply machine learning models for anomaly detection.
  ```python
  from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

  model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)
  df['anomaly'] = model.fit_predict(df[['column_name']])
  anomalies = df[df['anomaly'] == -1]
  ```

### 10. Continuous Improvement

#### Description:
Continuous improvement involves regularly reviewing and enhancing data quality processes and standards.

#### Techniques:
- **Feedback Loops**: Establish feedback loops to identify and address data quality issues.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Perform root cause analysis to understand and fix the underlying causes of data quality problems.
